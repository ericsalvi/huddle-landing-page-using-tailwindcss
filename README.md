## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code
- axe DevTools for accessibility

### What I learned

First time using TailwindCSS for one of these projects. Was challenging to get the solution look identical to the first time I submitted this same solution using SCSS.

### Continued development

I would like to get more proficient with TailwindCSS. Will plan on using it more with these projects.
